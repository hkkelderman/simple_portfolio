# Keene Kelderman's Data Portfolio

# Project 1: [Flatiron Capstone - MTBS Wildfire Analysis](https://github.com/hkkelderman/FI-MTBS_Fire_Analysis)
Used statistical testing and parametric and nonparametric modeling techniques to explore and model a federally maintained database of wildfires.

- Joined historical climate data from NOAA and geographical data from EPA to the wildfire dataset using GeoPandas
- Used parametric and nonparametric modeling to model fire size based on various climate and geographical data points
- Performed statistical testing in order to determine regions and states at risk for increased wildfire size
